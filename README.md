Please test the following:
- Cross species breeding (Both cultures require xenophile and should not be attacking each other)
- Orientations are added (romantic and sexual)
  - Orientations are added when children become adults. It could also be found in children earlier by random chance. When spawning in fresh new units, they will gain their orientations after a year.
  - In case you are not familiar with how orientations work, please look it up! It's pretty important
- Units may cheat and break up with each other. You can ensure this is working by hovering over their happiness meters. Cheating and breaking up is more likely when their ROMANTIC orientation preferences do not match up.
- Babies should not be MADE between partners (through sexual means) IF sexual orientations DO not match up.

- Traits
    - Preservation (A subspecies trait. Subspecies with this trait will ignore their orientations, morals and culture traits to DATE anyone they can reproduce with IF the subspecies population count is below a third of the harmony limit or below 50 units if there is no harmony limit.)
    - All orientation unit traits (Ensure that units aren't mixing and matching with units that don't fit their preferences. If you find units GET together when their romantic preferences DO not match, THAT is a bug. It is not HOWEVER a bug if you find two units with mismatched romantic preferences that are together. There is an explanation for this below)
    - Abroromantic and Abrosexual traits (These unit traits can be applied even when other romantic/sexual orientation traits are applied already. These traits include fluidity in the unit's orientation. If a unit is abroromantic, they are likely to change their romantic orientation over time. Same applies for the abrosexual but for sexual orientation. Thus, this may result in units changing their romantic orientations even when they are already in a relationship with someone else. THIS is intended AND not a bug. THEY will break up eventually as breaking up becomes MUCH more likely)
      - If you noticed a unit change their romantic/sexuality orientation from the traits above, they will note it down in their happiness history.
    - Homophobic & Heterophobic (Cultural traits that impact the units' mood. During conversation, units may bring up the topic of orientation which you will see indicated by a speech bubble above their head with their orientation in the bubble. If you see this, check their happiness history to see what they think)
    - Incest (Cultural trait)
    - Committed (Cultural trait. Cheating isn't allowed)
    - Mature Dating (Cultural trait. Animals will date within an age range that is appropriate. No more 18 year olds dating 90 year olds)
    - Orientationless (Cultural trait that completely nullifies the idea of orientations. This basically just removes orientations for the culture and units will act like the default game when it comes to romance)
    - Faithful & Unfaithful (Unit trait. This makes units either never cheat or more likely to cheat. The Commited cultural trait overrides this trait.)


Finally, if anything seems unbalanced let me know! For example if cheating doesn't seem like it happens enough with unfaithful or without, let me know!
